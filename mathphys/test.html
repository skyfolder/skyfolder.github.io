<h1>Chapter 1 – Infinite Series, Power Series</h1>

<h2>1. THE GEOMETRIC SERIES</h2>

<p>
As a simple example of many of the ideas involved in series, the text considers the geometric series. In a geometric progression we multiply each term by some fixed number to get the next term.
</p>

<pre>
(1.1a)  2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...
(1.1b)  1, 2/3, 4/9, 8/27, 16/81, ...
(1.1c)  a, ar, ar², ar³, ...
</pre>

<p>
Example: If the number of bacteria doubles every hour, then (1.1a) represents the multiplication factor after 1 hr, 2 hr, … . If a bouncing ball rises each time to 2/3 of the previous height, then (1.1b) represents the successive bounce heights (in yards) if the ball is dropped from 1 yard.
</p>

<p>
In the bacteria example, the quantity increases without limit. In the bouncing ball example, the bounce height decreases, and one may ask for the total distance traveled. The ball travels:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>down 1 yd,</li>
  <li>up 2/3 yd, down 2/3 yd,</li>
  <li>up 4/9 yd, down 4/9 yd, …</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus the total distance is written
</p>

<pre>
(1.2)  1 + 2·(2/3) + 2·(4/9) + 2·(8/27) + ···
     = 1 + 2(2/3 + 4/9 + 8/27 + ···).
</pre>

<p>
Here
</p>

<pre>
(1.3)  2/3 + 4/9 + 8/27 + ···
</pre>

<p>
is an infinite series. Not all infinite series have sums (for example, the geometric series with r ≥ 1). Even if a series has a finite sum, we cannot find it by ordinary finite addition, so we define the sum as a limit.
</p>

<p>
For a geometric progression (1.1c), the sum of n terms is
</p>

<pre>
(1.4)  Sₙ = a(1 - rⁿ)/(1 - r).
</pre>

<p>
In the example (1.3), with a = 2/3 and r = 2/3, we get
</p>

<pre>
(1.5)  Sₙ = 2(1 - (2/3)ⁿ).
</pre>

<p>
As n increases, (2/3)ⁿ → 0, so Sₙ → 2. Thus the sum of series (1.3) is 2, and from (1.2) the total distance is 1 + 2·2 = 5.
</p>

<p>
Definition: The sum of an infinite series is the limit of the partial sums Sₙ as n → ∞.
</p>

<p>
A geometric series has the form
</p>

<pre>
(1.6)  a + ar + ar² + ··· + arⁿ⁻¹ + ···.
</pre>

<p>
By (1.4), one shows that a geometric series converges if and only if |r| &lt; 1, and then
</p>

<pre>
(1.8)  S = a/(1 - r).
</pre>

<p>
Such a series is called convergent.
</p>

<p>
Repeating decimals can be written as geometric series. For example, 0.3333... = 3/10 + 3/100 + 3/1000 + ··· = (3/10)/(1 - 1/10) = 1/3.
</p>

<div class="problems">
  <h3>PROBLEMS, SECTION 1</h3>

  </ol>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>2. DEFINITIONS AND NOTATION</h2>

<p>
Examples of series:
</p>

<pre>
(2.1a)  1² + 2² + 3² + 4² + ···
(2.1b)  1/2 + 2/2² + 3/2³ + 4/2⁴ + ···
(2.1c)  x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x⁴/4 + ···
</pre>

<p>
A general infinite series is
</p>

<pre>
(2.2)  a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + ··· + aₙ + ···,
</pre>

<p>
where aₙ are numbers or functions defined by some rule. Often we write a general term explicitly:
</p>

<pre>
(2.3a)  1² + 2² + 3² + ··· + n² + ···
(2.3b)  x - x² + x³/2 + ··· + (-1)ⁿ⁻¹ xⁿ/(n-1)! + ···
</pre>

<p>
The factorial n! is defined as the product 1·2·…·n for integer n ≥ 1, and 0! = 1.
</p>

<p>
Series are compactly written with sigma notation, e.g.
</p>

<pre>
(2.4)  ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ n².
</pre>

<p>
A sequence is simply a list of quantities indexed by n. A series is the indicated sum of a sequence. We are interested in limits of various sequences (terms aₙ, partial sums Sₙ, remainders Rₙ, ratios ρₙ, etc.) as n → ∞.
</p>

<p><b>Example (limit of a sequence):</b></p>

<pre>
limₙ→∞ [ (2n - 1)⁴ + √(1 + 9n⁸) ] / [ 1 - n³ - 7n⁴ ].
</pre>

<p>
Divide numerator and denominator by n⁴ and take limits.
</p>

<div class="problems">
  <h3>PROBLEMS, SECTION 2</h3>
  <p>Compute various limits of sequences as n → ∞.</p>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>3. APPLICATIONS OF SERIES</h2>

<p>
Series are useful because often the first few terms approximate the total sum to good accuracy. Many applied problems yield answers in terms of infinite series; differential equations and partial differential equations are frequently solved by series. Power series (series in powers of x) are later used to define functions of complex variables and of matrices, and to represent special functions (Fourier, Legendre, Bessel, etc.).
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4. CONVERGENT AND DIVERGENT SERIES</h2>

<p>
If a series has a finite sum, it is called convergent; otherwise divergent. One must be careful applying algebra to divergent series.
</p>

<p>Example of a divergent series:</p>

<pre>
(4.1)  S = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + ···.
</pre>

<p>
Formally,
</p>

<pre>
2S = 2 + 4 + 8 + ··· = S - 1 ⇒ S = -1 (nonsense).
</pre>

<p>
Harmonic series:
</p>

<pre>
(4.2)  1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + ···
</pre>

<p>
diverges. On the other hand,
</p>

<pre>
(4.3)  1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 - ···
</pre>

<p>
converges as written, but rearrangement of terms can change its sum or destroy convergence.
</p>

<h3>4.1 Definition via partial sums</h3>

<p>
Let the series be
</p>

<pre>
(4.4)  a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + a₄ + ··· + aₙ + ···
</pre>

<p>
Partial sums:
</p>

<pre>
(4.5)  S₁ = a₁,
       S₂ = a₁ + a₂,
       S₃ = a₁ + a₂ + a₃,
       ···,
       Sₙ = a₁ + a₂ + ··· + aₙ.
</pre>

<p>
If
</p>

<pre>
(4.6)  limₙ→∞ Sₙ = S
</pre>

<p>
exists and is finite, the series is convergent with sum S. The remainder after n terms is
</p>

<pre>
(4.7)  Rₙ = S - Sₙ,  with  limₙ→∞ Rₙ = 0.
</pre>

<p>
Examples: geometric series remainder; telescoping series; a logarithmic series where aₙ → 0 but the sum diverges.
</p>

<div class="problems">
  <h3>PROBLEMS, SECTION 4</h3>
  <p>Write formulas for aₙ, Sₙ, Rₙ and compute their limits for several series.</p>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>5. TESTING SERIES FOR CONVERGENCE; THE PRELIMINARY TEST</h2>

<h3>5.1 Preliminary test</h3>

<p>
If the terms aₙ of an infinite series do not tend to zero, i.e. limₙ→∞ aₙ ≠ 0, then the series diverges. If limₙ→∞ aₙ = 0, one must use further tests.
</p>

<p>
This test never proves convergence; it only quickly identifies some divergent series. For example, the harmonic series has terms → 0 but diverges.
</p>

<div class="problems">
  <h3>PROBLEMS, SECTION 5</h3>
  <p>Apply the preliminary test to given series; prove the test using (4.6) and aₙ = Sₙ - Sₙ₋₁.</p>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>6. CONVERGENCE TESTS FOR SERIES OF POSITIVE TERMS; ABSOLUTE CONVERGENCE</h2>

<p>
We consider series with positive terms. For a series with mixed signs, we can consider the series of absolute values |aₙ|. If ∑|aₙ| converges, we say the original series is absolutely convergent, and absolute convergence implies convergence.
</p>

<h3>6.1 Comparison test</h3>

<p>(a) If ∑mₙ is a convergent series of positive terms and |aₙ| ≤ mₙ eventually, then ∑aₙ converges absolutely.</p>
<p>(b) If ∑dₙ is divergent and |aₙ| ≥ dₙ eventually, then ∑aₙ diverges.</p>

<h3>6.2 Integral test</h3>

<p>
If aₙ are positive and eventually nonincreasing, think of aₙ as values of a function a(n). Then ∑aₙ converges iff the improper integral ∫ a(n) dn (from some finite point to ∞) converges.
</p>

<p>Example: harmonic series tested by ∫₁^∞ (1/n) dn = ∞ ⇒ divergence.</p>

<h3>6.3 Ratio test</h3>

<p>
Define
</p>

<pre>
(6.2)  ρₙ = |aₙ₊₁/aₙ|,     ρ = limₙ→∞ ρₙ.
</pre>

<p>
Then
</p>

<pre>
(6.3)  if ρ < 1, series converges;
       if ρ > 1, series diverges;
       if ρ = 1, test is inconclusive.
</pre>

<h3>6.4 Special comparison (limit) test</h3>

<p>
Comparing aₙ with bₙ via aₙ/bₙ → L (finite, or positive) to transfer convergence/divergence from a known series to the one under test.
</p>

<div class="problems">
  <h3>PROBLEMS, SECTION 6</h3>
  <p>Use comparison, integral, ratio, and special comparison tests on various series.</p>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>7. ALTERNATING SERIES</h2>

<p>
Alternating series: terms are successively plus and minus, e.g.
</p>

<pre>
(7.1)  1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 - ··· + (-1)ⁿ⁺¹ / n + ···.
</pre>

<p>
Absolute values give the harmonic series, which diverges, so (7.1) is not absolutely convergent. However, as an alternating series it converges by the alternating series test:
</p>

<p>
If aₙ > 0 decreases to 0 and the series is ∑(-1)ⁿaₙ, then the series converges.
</p>

<div class="problems">
  <h3>PROBLEMS, SECTION 7</h3>
  <p>Test various alternating series. Prove that absolute convergence implies convergence.</p>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>8. CONDITIONALLY CONVERGENT SERIES</h2>

<p>
A series that converges but not absolutely is conditionally convergent. For such series, rearranging terms can change the sum or even cause divergence. The alternating harmonic series is the canonical example.
</p>

<p>
A physical interpretation with alternating positive and negative charges along a line shows how order matters in interpreting conditionally convergent series in applications.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>9. USEFUL FACTS ABOUT SERIES</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Multiplying all terms by a nonzero constant or changing finitely many terms does not affect convergence/divergence.</li>
  <li>Two convergent series can be added/subtracted termwise; the resulting series converges, and its sum is the sum/difference of the sums.</li>
  <li>If a series is absolutely convergent, rearrangements do not affect convergence or sum; this is not true for conditionally convergent series.</li>
</ol>

<div class="problems">
  <h3>PROBLEMS, SECTION 9</h3>
  <p>Test given series for convergence/divergence, choosing appropriate tests.</p>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>10. POWER SERIES; INTERVAL OF CONVERGENCE</h2>

<p>
A power series has the form
</p>

<pre>
(10.1) ∑ₙ₌0^∞ aₙ xⁿ  or  ∑ₙ₌0^∞ aₙ (x - a)ⁿ.
</pre>

<p>
Examples (10.2a–d) show different power series. For each x, the series may converge or diverge; the set of x for which it converges forms an interval (for real x) called the interval of convergence.
</p>

<p>
The ratio test is typically used to find the region where |x| is small enough that the series converges; endpoints must be checked separately. Depending on the series, it may converge at neither, one, or both endpoints.
</p>

<div class="problems">
  <h3>PROBLEMS, SECTION 10</h3>
  <p>Find intervals of convergence for various power series, including endpoint tests.</p>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>11. THEOREMS ABOUT POWER SERIES</h2>

<p>Within the interval of convergence, a power series behaves like a polynomial:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A power series may be differentiated or integrated term by term; the resulting series converges to the derivative/integral in the same interval of convergence.</li>
  <li>Two power series can be added, subtracted, multiplied; and under conditions, divided. The quotient series has at least some nontrivial interval of convergence.</li>
  <li>One convergent power series may be substituted into another if values lie within the interval of convergence.</li>
  <li>The power series representation of a function is unique.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>12. EXPANDING FUNCTIONS IN POWER SERIES</h2>

<p>
Often we find a power series representation of a given function. One method: assume an expansion and determine coefficients via derivatives.
</p>

<p>
For sin x, assume:
</p>

<pre>
(12.1)  sin x = a₀ + a₁x + a₂x² + ···
</pre>

<p>
Evaluate at x = 0 and differentiate repeatedly to solve for a₀, a₁, a₂, … . This yields
</p>

<pre>
(12.5)  sin x = x - x³/3! + x⁵/5! - ··· .
</pre>

<p>
In general, for a function f(x), the Taylor series about x = a is
</p>

<pre>
(12.8)  f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + f''(a)/2! (x-a)² + ··· + f⁽ⁿ⁾(a)/n! (x-a)ⁿ + ··· .
</pre>

<p>
The case a=0 is the Maclaurin series:
</p>

<pre>
(12.9)  f(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + f''(0)x²/2! + f⁽³⁾(0)x³/3! + ··· .
</pre>

<div class="problems">
  <h3>PROBLEMS, SECTION 12</h3>
  <p>Verify basic Maclaurin series (13.1–13.5) by the differentiation method.</p>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>13. TECHNIQUES FOR OBTAINING POWER SERIES EXPANSIONS</h2>

<p>
The Taylor-derivative method is sometimes cumbersome; other techniques include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multiplying by polynomials or by other series</li>
  <li>Dividing series (long division) to get series for ratios</li>
  <li>Using the binomial series</li>
  <li>Substituting polynomials or series into known expansions</li>
  <li>Using integration or differentiation of known series</li>
  <li>Using a computer to generate coefficients</li>
</ul>

<h3>13.1 Basic Maclaurin series</h3>

<pre>
(13.1) sin x = ∑ₙ₌0^∞ (-1)ⁿ x²ⁿ⁺¹/(2n+1)!   (all x)
(13.2) cos x = ∑ₙ₌0^∞ (-1)ⁿ x²ⁿ/(2n)!       (all x)
(13.3) eˣ     = ∑ₙ₌0^∞ xⁿ/n!               (all x)
(13.4) ln(1 + x) = ∑ₙ₌1^∞ (-1)ⁿ⁺¹ xⁿ/n     (-1 < x ≤ 1)
(13.5) (1 + x)ᵖ = ∑ₙ₌0^∞ (p choose n) xⁿ    (|x| < 1)
</pre>

<p>
These should be memorized and reused.
</p>

<p>
Examples show how to obtain new series like (x+1) sin x, eˣ cos x, tan x, √(1+x), 1/(1+x), e^{-x²}, e^{tan x}, arc tan x, ln x about x=1, etc.
</p>

<div class="problems">
  <h3>PROBLEMS, SECTION 13</h3>
  <p>Practice series manipulations: multiplying, dividing, substituting, binomial expansions, Taylor expansions at nonzero points.</p>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>14. ACCURACY OF SERIES APPROXIMATIONS</h2>

<p>
One must ask:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Does the Taylor/Maclaurin series actually converge to the function?</li>
  <li>How fast does it converge (how many terms are needed for a given accuracy)?</li>
</ol>

<p>
The remainder term Rₙ(x) (difference between function and truncated series) is
</p>

<pre>
(14.2)  Rₙ(x) = (x-a)ⁿ⁺¹ f⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾(c)/(n+1)!,
</pre>

<p>
for some c between a and x. This can sometimes be used to prove convergence to the function.
</p>

<h3>14.1 Error estimates</h3>

<p>
For an alternating series satisfying the alternating series test, the error in truncating after n terms is less than |aₙ₊₁|:
</p>

<pre>
(14.3)  |S - (a₁ + ... + aₙ)| ≤ |aₙ₊₁|.
</pre>

<p>
For power series ∑aₙxⁿ with |x|<1 and |aₙ₊₁| ≤ |aₙ| for large n, the error after N terms satisfies
</p>

<pre>
(14.4)  |S - ∑ₙ₌₀^N aₙxⁿ| < |a_{N+1} x^{N+1}|/(1 - |x|).
</pre>

<p>
Thus the first neglected term often gives a useful error estimate away from the boundary of convergence.
</p>

<div class="problems">
  <h3>PROBLEMS, SECTION 14</h3>
  <p>Prove the error bounds and apply them to simple approximations like √(1+x), sin x, 1-cos x, ln(1-x), etc.</p>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>15. SOME USES OF SERIES</h2>

<h3>15.1 Numerical computation and cancellation</h3>

<p>
Example: Evaluate f(x) = ln((1+x)/(1-x)) - tan x at x=0.0015. Direct computation causes catastrophic cancellation because both terms are very close in value; series expansions reveal the small difference (on the order of x⁵) and give accurate results.
</p>

<h3>15.2 Summing series via function identities</h3>

<p>
Since f(x) = ∑aₙxⁿ, evaluating at a specific x gives numerical series whose sum equals f(x). For instance, substituting x=1 into ln(1+x) gives the alternating harmonic series sum ln 2.
</p>

<h3>15.3 Integrals via series</h3>

<p>
Using termwise integration of power series, integrals such as ∫₀^t sin(x²) dx (Fresnel integrals) can be approximated for small t by integrating the series expansion of sin(x²).
</p>

<h3>15.4 Indeterminate forms and L’Hôpital’s rule</h3>

<p>
Series are especially effective for limits as x→0 of 0/0-type expressions. e.g.
</p>

<pre>
limₓ→0 (1 - eˣ)/x
</pre>

<p>
can be evaluated by expanding eˣ and simplifying, rather than using L’Hôpital.
</p>

<h3>15.5 Physical approximations</h3>

<p>
Examples: simple pendulum motion approximated by sin θ ≈ θ for small θ; radioactive decay data analysis via series for e^{-λt}.
</p>

<div class="problems">
  <h3>PROBLEMS, SECTION 15</h3>
  <p>
    Various tasks: numerical evaluation using series, derivative evaluations at 0, limit evaluations, approximating integrals, summing series by recognizing them as known Maclaurin series at specific values, applications in relativity, mechanics, finance, geometry.
  </p>
